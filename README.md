# User-Course-Database
Implementation of a many-to-many relationship in a data model using Python and SQLite3

Two tables, user and course have a many-to-many relationship. A junction table is created with a composite primary key created from the
user_id and course_id. A python script parses a json array and inserts course and user information into the two tables, then extracts the
autogenerated sequential user_id and course_id from the respective tables before inserting the composite ids into the junction table member.
The junction table also contains the role of that user in the course.

User and course information can then be accessed with a simple select query.
